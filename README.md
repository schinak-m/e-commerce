# E-commerce Website 

I've built this Website using Vue.js, Vuex and Tailwind CSS for the Front-end and I've also used the DummyJS API for fetching the Data of the Website.

Here's what it can do:
* Users can Browse the Homepage and see what Categories the Website offers
* Users can click on the different Categories and browse through the Products
* Users can click the Products and a Product Details Page will be shown
* The Product Details Page shows the Price and a Description of the Product
* The Quantity of the Product can be selected and the Product can be added to the Shopping Cart
* In The Shopping Cart the Total Price will be shown 
* If the User doesn't want a Product anymore it can be removed from the Shopping Cart
* Users can visit the Checkout Page and enter their information afterwards
